# RadarPolar
Extension for Qlik Sense, experiment for a school project.

## Info
This is a basic 1 dimension, 1 measure radar and polar chart extension for Qlik Sense that I made to have a better understanding of how Qlik Sense extensions work. And because I like to do stuff like this :D

I used Chart.js and based my chart on another implementation of a Polar Chart:

## Warning!!!
This was just an experiment, so don't use this extension for production! The code is free to use, change, ...!
